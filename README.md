Predicting Customer Churn using Machine Learning


Business Problem
Many businesses, especially in subscription-based services, telecom, banking, and e-commerce, struggle with customer churnâ€”the loss of customers over time. Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. However, identifying which customers are likely to leave is challenging without data-driven insights.

Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to identify customers likely to churn.

Features of the Project
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and data balancing using SMOTE.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key features and identifying patterns in customer behavior.
- Feature Engineering: Transforming data to enhance predictive power.
- Model Training & Evaluation: Using Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers, and evaluating them with accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance with RandomizedSearchCV.
- Deployment: Saving the best-performing model using pickle.

Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn (machine learning models and evaluation)
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE for handling imbalanced datasets)
- XGBoost
- Pickle (for model persistence)

Goals
1. Predict customer churn using machine learning techniques.
2. Identify key features that contribute to customer churn.
3. Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning.
4. Deploy the best-performing model for future predictions.

This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting customer churn, which can help businesses reduce customer loss and improve retention strategies.
